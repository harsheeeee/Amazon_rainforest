# Amazon_rainforest

### MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT
## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop models that accurately forecast the area of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. This involves understanding historical trends in deforestation, identifying factors contributing to deforestation, and building predictive models to anticipate future deforestation patterns. The ultimate goal is to provide insights that can inform policymakers and stakeholders to take proactive measures in preserving the Amazon rainforest.

## Methodology
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Deforestation Data**: Obtained from TerraBrasilis, providing historical records of deforestation in the Amazonian states and municipalities.
- **Economic Data**: Gathered from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, including GDP and GDP per capita information for the relevant regions and time periods.
- **Preprocessing**: Imputation of missing values, feature engineering (e.g., computing deforestation increment), and normalization of data to prepare it for modeling.

### Data Visualization
- Visual exploration of the distribution of deforestation area.
- Time series analysis to understand deforestation trends over time.
- Autocorrelation plots to identify patterns in the time series data.
- Comparative analysis of deforestation trends across different states in the Amazon.

### Data Modeling
#### Time Series Forecasting
- Utilization of ARIMA model for time series forecasting.
- Application of linear regression and stochastic gradient descent for one-step forecasting.

#### Ensemble Stacking
- Implementation of an ensemble stacking approach using multiple regression models (Lasso, MLP Regressor, SVR, SVM, Random Forest) as the base layer.
- Meta layer integration with Linear Regression to enhance predictive performance.

#### Multistate Modeling
- Exploration of ensemble methods with raw and normalized data.
- Deployment of Gradient Boosted Regression, XGradient Boosted Regression, and Random Forest Regression models tailored to individual state data.
- Averaging predictions to enhance model robustness.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts

## Conclusion
The project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting deforestation trends in the Amazon rainforest. The linear regression model emerges as the top performer in time series forecasting, while ensemble stacking demonstrates promising results, particularly with Random Forest as a strong base model. Insights gained from this analysis can aid policymakers and stakeholders in implementing proactive measures to address deforestation and preserve the Amazonian ecosystem.
